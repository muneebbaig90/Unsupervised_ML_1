🔍 Unsupervised Machine Learning Models

This repository contains implementations of popular unsupervised learning algorithms, focusing on clustering and association rule mining. These models were applied to different datasets to explore hidden patterns, groupings, and relationships without labeled outputs.

📌 Implemented Models
🔹 Clustering

K-Means Clustering – partitions data into k clusters by minimizing intra-cluster distance.

Hierarchical Clustering – builds a hierarchy of clusters using linkage methods, visualized with a dendrogram to decide the optimal number of clusters.

🔹 Association Rule Learning

Apriori Algorithm – breadth-first search approach that generates frequent itemsets by scanning the database multiple times and applies the Apriori property.

Eclat Algorithm – depth-first search approach using Transaction ID (TID) sets and set intersections for efficient frequent itemset mining with fewer database scans.

⚡ Features

Implemented in Python using scikit-learn, mlxtend, and numpy.

Applied on sample datasets to extract clusters and association rules.

Visualized clustering results with matplotlib and dendrograms.

Evaluated rules with support, confidence, and lift.
